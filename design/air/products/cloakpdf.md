## CloakPDF product requirements

- Scope: landing, all standalone utilities, persistent editor, every tool panel,
  overview/thumbnails, canvas overlays, command palette, export, privacy, AI model
  flows, loading/error boundary, encrypted-file notices and PWA updates.
- Document content remains local. Static code, OCR language data and optional AI
  models may require downloads. Do not promise cold-cache offline availability.
- Keep the stage mounted when tools change; preserve zoom, selection, history,
  document bytes, cancellation, progress and export behaviour. Mobile retains a
  reachable preview and working panel; short/landscape layouts need real reflow.
- PDF content, annotation colour, redaction masks and signature strokes are user
  content. The canvas surround, selection controls and every custom widget use Air.
- Redaction must permanently remove selected content using the existing verified
  export path. Preserve rasterisation/file-size/selectable-text disclosures.
- Keep standalone multi-input/security/read-only tools distinct from single-document
  editor operations. Registries own tool identity and availability.
- Preserve model consent, hardware requirements, download size/progress/cancel,
  cache/error/retry states, and source-grounded Ask PDF behaviour.
- Required gates before a code commit: `vp check`, `pnpm check:dead`, `pnpm test`,
  `pnpm run build`, and applicable `pnpm test:e2e:smoke`, `pnpm test:e2e:extended`
  and `pnpm test:e2e` suites. Inspect exported results and run the family visual
  matrix; never infer all-feature coverage from the home page.
- Keep a per-component/state inventory and evidence in `docs/air/`. Local tokens
  and this complete contract travel with the repository.
